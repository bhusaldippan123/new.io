3.3 REFORMATION
The Medieval Catholic Church came to be associated with superstitions, corruption and greed for money. Superstitious peasants were convinced by the Church that it possessed the true Cross. People were used to paying fees for seeing a piece of wood as the true Cross because it was believed that sacred relics had healing power. The Church laid more emphasis on blind faith than reason as it was the means to extract money from the devotees. All this changed with the coming of the Renaissance. In the new spirit of the Renaissance nothing could be accepted. Do you know that it was in 1517 AD that a German priest called Martin Luther first challenged the authority of the Roman Catholic Church? According to him, the Bible was the only source of religious authority. He believed that salvation could be attained through faith in Jesus Christ instead of having blind faith on the Church. He protested against some practices of the Church such as the selling of positions in the church, the issuing of the letters of indulgence for works of charity or going on crusades, to the highest bidder. Luther had the protection of the German Princes, primarily because of his desire to seize church property. But on 3 January 1521, he was excommunicated by Pope Leo X after he refused to stop writing against the Church.
